let  name = "Rohit"
let age = 18
let isLoggedIn = false
let state = null;     //eg: if want temperature, server cant pass 0(coz its not applicable), hence NULL

//number => range => 2 to power 53
//bigint (used to make big web apps, eg: stock market app, facebook, reddit)
//string = ""
//null => standalone value
//undefined
// symbol (implementation mostly used in ReactJs for components)

//object 
console.log(typeof "ROhit")
console.log(typeof undefined)   //o/p: undefined is a type in itself
console.log(typeof null)        //o/p :whereas, null is an object (useful for interview questions)
